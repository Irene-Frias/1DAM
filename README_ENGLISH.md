## 📌 About  
This repository contains exercises, projects, and resources developed during the **Cross-Platform Application Development** (Grado Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma - DAM) course at **I.E.S. Belén (Málaga)**.

The aim of this vocational training program is to prepare students to design, develop, and maintain applications for various platforms (desktop, mobile, and web), using current programming languages, tools, and methodologies.

Each folder is organized by subject and includes content related to key areas such as programming, databases, systems, markup languages, digitalization, and sustainability. Projects integrate theoretical learning with practical application, promoting autonomy, problem-solving, and teamwork.

This repository is part of a personal learning portfolio and reflects the skills acquired throughout the first academic year of the training process.
