## 📌 About  
This repository contains exercises, projects, and resources developed during the **Cross-Platform Application Development** (Grado Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma - DAM) course at **I.E.S. Belén (Málaga)**.

Each folder is organized by subject and includes work related to key areas such as programming, databases, systems, web development, digitalization, and sustainability. The projects combine theoretical learning with practical implementation, encouraging autonomy, problem-solving, and collaborative work.
